          Rubber duck debugging is used around the world by millions of
          programmers. As the name suggests, rubber duck debugging refers to
          debugging your code with the aid of a rubber duck. You describe and
          explain each step of your code, in detail, to the duck, until you
          notice the problem that's been causing the unexpected behavior. But
          what if you donâ€™t have a rubber duck? Have you already heard about the
          rubber duck debugging and want to try a digital version? Would you
          like to try rubber duck debugging and want your duck to also have
          additional functionality? Introducing Quack The Code, your very own
          digital rubber duck coding companion!
        </p>
        <p>
          Quack The Code is a website and desktop app which brings you all the
          aid of rubber duck debugging. You can explain your code, line by line,
          to it and it sits patiently listening for you to notice your mistake.
          If you canâ€™t figure it on your own, it can ask you guided questions
          when you need help. It also provides you with inspirational quotes,
          facts, advice, jokes, and coding quizzes on the click of a button or
          your voice commands. Along with the visual app, we also provide to you
          smart home speaker plugins so you can get hands free help and support.
